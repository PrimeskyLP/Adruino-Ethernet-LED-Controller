An Script for an Adruino whit an Ehternet Shield where you can Controll and Digital LED via. an Browser

This is my First Script for an Adruino an i am using effects from the NEO-Pixel Libary.

This script is slow when you try to Acces via. an Browser but it gets the job done.

You need:

2:Adruino Ethernet Shield

4:5V Power Supply 
5:2x Data Cabel
6:Digital LED
